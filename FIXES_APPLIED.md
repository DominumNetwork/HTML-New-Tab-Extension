# Custom New Tab Extension Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. HTML Content Corruption on Save/Load
**Problem**: When uploading HTML files and saving them, the content would get corrupted, especially CSS and complex HTML structures.

**Root Cause**: The extension was using `innerHTML` to directly set HTML content, which caused:
- HTML entities to be double-encoded
- Self-closing tags to be modified by the browser's parser
- CSS and JavaScript to be re-parsed and potentially corrupted
- Special characters to be mangled during storage

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added Base64 encoding/decoding for content storage to preserve exact formatting
- Implemented safe HTML parsing using `DOMParser` to prevent corruption
- Added proper UTF-8 handling for file uploads
- Added encoding metadata to track when content is encoded
- Separated head elements (CSS/meta tags) from body content for better handling

**Files Modified**:
- `js/popup.js`: Added encoding/decoding functions and improved file handling
- `js/newtab.js`: Added decoding support and safer HTML content setting

### 2. Extension Popup Not Opening from New Tab Button
**Problem**: Clicking the "Customize Page" button in the new tab page would redirect to the extension's options page instead of opening the actual toolbar popup.

**Root Cause**: The extension was using `chrome.runtime.openOptionsPage()` which opens the options page, not the popup. The `chrome.action.openPopup()` API has limitations and often fails when called from certain contexts.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added a background service worker to handle popup opening requests
- Implemented message passing between the new tab page and background script
- Added multiple fallback mechanisms:
  1. Try `chrome.action.openPopup()` directly
  2. Send message to background script to open popup
  3. Fallback to options page if popup fails
- Made the function async to handle promise-based API properly

**Files Modified**:
- `js/newtab.js`: Updated `openSettings()` function with proper popup handling
- `js/background.js`: Created new background service worker
- `manifest.json`: Added background service worker configuration

### 3. Popup Closes During File Upload
**Problem**: When trying to upload HTML files through the popup, the popup would close when the file dialog opened, preventing users from completing the upload process.

**Root Cause**: Browser extension popups automatically close when they lose focus, which happens when file dialogs open or when users click outside the popup.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added detection for popup vs tab mode based on window dimensions and URL parameters
- Created a modal dialog that appears when users try to upload in popup mode
- Added "Upload File" button in new tab page that opens extension in tab mode directly
- Implemented tab mode with larger interface and better file handling
- Added automatic tab opening when file operations are detected in popup mode

**Features Added**:
- Tab mode toggle button (üìÑ) in popup header
- Dedicated "üìÅ Upload File" button in new tab page
- Modal dialog explaining why tab mode is needed for uploads
- Responsive tab mode interface with larger editor
- Seamless transition between popup and tab modes

**Files Modified**:
- `js/popup.js`: Added popup detection, tab mode functions, and upload dialog
- `js/newtab.js`: Added `openSettingsInTab()` function and upload button
- `popup.html`: Added CSS styles for dialog, tab mode, and button layouts
- `newtab.html`: Added upload button and improved button group layout
- `manifest.json`: Added `activeTab` permission for tab operations

### 4. HTML Content Style Isolation
**Problem**: Custom HTML content with global CSS styles (like `* { margin: 0; }` and `body` styles) was bleeding into the main new tab page, causing layout issues and elements to shift to the side.

**Root Cause**: The custom HTML content was being inserted directly into the page DOM, causing CSS conflicts between the custom content's styles and the extension's default styles.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added iframe-based isolation as the primary method for complete style separation
- Created a fallback system with CSS scoping and isolation containers
- Implemented proper CSS reset and scoping for custom content
- Added automatic script re-execution in isolated containers
- Fixed positioning to ensure custom content fills the entire viewport

**Features Added**:
- Iframe isolation for complete style separation
- CSS scoping fallback for browsers with iframe restrictions
- Automatic style conflict resolution
- Proper script handling in isolated content
- Full viewport coverage for custom content

**Files Modified**:
- `js/newtab.js`: Complete rewrite of `setCustomContent()` with isolation
- `newtab.html`: Updated CSS for custom content container positioning

## Technical Improvements

### Content Preservation
- Files are now read with explicit UTF-8 encoding
- Content is Base64 encoded before storage to prevent corruption
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing saved content
- Added proper error handling for encoding/decoding failures

### Popup Opening Reliability
- Multi-tier fallback system ensures button always works
- Background service worker provides proper popup opening context
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### Storage Optimization
- Chunking system preserved for large files
- Added encoding metadata for future compatibility
- Cleaned up storage key management

## Testing Recommendations

1. **HTML Content Testing**:
   - Upload HTML files with complex CSS (flexbox, grid, animations)
   - Test files with special characters and Unicode
   - Verify CSS styles are preserved exactly
   - Test JavaScript code preservation

2. **Popup Opening Testing**:
   - Click "Customize Page" button in new tab
   - Verify popup opens instead of redirecting
   - Test in different browser contexts (normal/incognito)

3. **File Upload Testing**:
   - Try uploading files through popup (should show dialog)
   - Click "üìÅ Upload File" from new tab (should open in tab)
   - Test drag-and-drop in both popup and tab modes
   - Verify tab mode toggle button (üìÑ) works from popup
   - Ensure uploaded files preserve formatting exactly

4. **Style Isolation Testing**:
   - Test HTML files with global CSS resets (`* { margin: 0; }`)
   - Test content with `body` and `html` styles
   - Verify custom content fills entire viewport without affecting default UI
   - Test complex layouts (flexbox, grid, absolute positioning)
   - Ensure scripts in custom content execute properly

5. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Existing saved content should load correctly
   - No data loss during upgrade

## Notes

- The popup opening fix uses modern Manifest V3 APIs
- Content encoding is transparent to users
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Performance impact is minimal due to efficient encoding
